## About Me
I have over 10 years of experience in both B2B and B2C trading. 6 years of experience as an entrepreneur and Internet marketing. I create commercial landing pages on constructors (the sites are still working), using various marketing tools, I direct traffic, and I transfer the customers who applied to partners. I have always liked the field of programming. Now I study with pleasure and set a goal to become a good specialist.
